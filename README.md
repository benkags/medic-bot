# MedicBot

## Description
MedicBot will monitor important processes required for the smooth running of servers and if and when problems are detected, it will post to slack (Automated monitoring) and attempt to correct the problem (Automated maintenance).

The individual monitoring/maintenance components are built as plugins and additional plugins could be added as needed.  At the most basic level the medic-bot source code is a periodic task scheduler that runs provided scripts (plugins) on a list of hosts based on the specified schedule which is configurable.  It provides what webapps like StatusCake provide but also much more, as you can write completely new node.js plugins that can do anything. (E.g. Monitor the changing of an exchange rate from a certain website and send notifications when there is a change.)

## Plugins Provided with the Code
* Monitor that a server instance is up and running (Configurable schedule) - `server_live_test.js` plugin

## Upcoming Plugins:
* CouchDB Monitoring
* Nginx Monitoring
* API Monitoring
* SMS Gateway Monitoring
* Backup Process Monitoring

### Medic Mobile Webapp Related Monitoring
* Monitor the health of projects
  * Date of last report (days ago)
  * Pending outgoing messages that SMS Gateway has yet to pick up
  * Disk and Memory Utilization
  * Database compaction status
* Post nightly updates on Slack concerning the state of the servers it monitors.

### Automated Maintenance
Perform common maintence tasks automatically
* Instance is down
  * Post notification on Slack, tag relevant people
  * Keep posting notification on Slack every 5 minutes until instance is back up
* CouchDB, Nginx, Medic-API, or Sentinel is down
  * Post notification on Slack
  * Restart the process that crashed
  * Check that the process is running after a couple of minutes
  * Post notification on Slack that the specific process is now running
  * Collect logs and upload them for diagnosis

## Notes
* MedicBot needs to be supervised by another process like Supervisord so that it is always up and running and is restarted in case of crashes
